Today we practice linux commands, as those in this link:
https://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/doc/suse/suse9.0/userguide-9.0/ch24s04.html

and we also used filezilla client to be able to browse and edit the files on the remote server:
https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client

Then we investigate the basics of python os library:
==================
>>> import os
>>> os.getcwd()
'/home/sp18/hghaly'
>>> os.mkdir("new_py_dir")
>>> fname="new_file.txt"
>>> fopen=open(fname)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'new_file.txt'
>>> fopen=open(fname,"w")
>>> content="Here we go, let's put some content in"
>>> fopen.write(content)
>>> fopen.close()
==================
